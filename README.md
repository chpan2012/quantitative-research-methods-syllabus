📊 Quantitative Research Methods: Research Thinking & AI Implementation
114th Academic Year, 1st Semester
"From Data to Insight: Your AI-Powered Research Journey"

📖 About This Course

This repository hosts the Interactive Syllabus for the course "Quantitative Research Methods: Research Thinking and AI Implementation".
Unlike traditional statistics courses that focus heavily on rote memorization of formulas or complex coding, this course adopts a "Low-Code, High-Thinking" approach. We leverage Generative AI (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) as a personal research coach to guide students through the entire research process—from hypothesis generation to data interpretation.

🎯 Core Philosophy

AI as a Coach: Learning to dialogue with AI to clarify concepts, simulate data, and interpret statistical outputs.
Project-Based Learning (PBL): Students build their own research projects week by week.
Critical Thinking: Focus on the why and so what of data, rather than just the how of software operation.

🌐 Interactive Syllabus Features

The core of this repository is the index.html file, which serves as a fully functional, interactive course website.

Key Features:

Weekly Accordion Schedule: A collapsible breakdown of the 16-week curriculum, organizing content into four main modules:

Module 1: Foundation of Research

Module 2: Data Exploration & Visualization

Module 3: Hypothesis Testing (t-test, ANOVA, Chi-square)

Module 4: Predictive Modeling (Correlation, Regression, Mediation)

Pop-up Challenge Guides: Interactive modals providing specific AI prompts for advanced learners (e.g., "Role-play as a statistician to critique this method").

Integrated Resource Hub: Direct download links for all course datasets (CSV & SAV formats).

W14 Full-Scale Simulation: A special interactive module for Week 14, featuring a "Final Project Rehearsal" scenario with a dedicated dataset.
